        <div class="title">INTRODUCTION</div>

        <div class="detail">
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
            make a purchase from www.nepscart.com (the “Site”).
        </div>

        <div class="title">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>

        <div class="detail">When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
            including
            information
            about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that
            you
            view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with
            the
            Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</div>

        <div class="detail">We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</div>

        <div class="detail">- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
            anonymous unique
            identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
            - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
            Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
            - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
            the
            Site.</div>

        <div class="detail">Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we
            collect certain
            information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including
            your card numbers, esewa, khalti), email address, and phone number. We refer
            to
            this information as “Order Information.”</div>

        <div class="detail">When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
            Device
            Information
            and Order Information.</div>

        <div class="title">HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</div>

        <div class="detail"> We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through

            confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
            Communicate with you;
            Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
            When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
            relating
            to our products or services.
            We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
            your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics
            about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
            advertising campaigns).
